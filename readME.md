# Energy-Efficient Smart City Planner

## Project Overview
Urbanization is driving a rapid increase in energy demand, straining city resources and causing inefficiencies and higher carbon emissions. The **Energy-Efficient Smart City Planner** addresses these challenges by leveraging AI and real-time IoT data to enable smarter, greener city management.

This project helps city planners make informed, eco-friendly decisions by combining intelligent analytics and real-time insights.
